# LIRI-Bot

## Creating a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface using Node.js and npm

### LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data

#### Try the following commands in the CLI! -

    * `my-tweets`

    * `spotify-this-song`

    * `movie-this`

    * `do-what-it-says`

##### Follow the Spotify and Movie queries with a track name or movie name

    * If you do not enter anything following the commands, the LIRI app will return a default query for "The Sign" by Ace of Base, and Mr. Nobody respectively

###### If you do not enter any commands, LIRI will return a 'movie-this' search for Star Wars

#### The Results will be logged into log.txt & printed to the console
